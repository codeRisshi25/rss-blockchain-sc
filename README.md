# RSS Blockchain

RSS Blockchain is a decentralized application designed to manage and secure sensitive data using blockchain technology. This project focuses on providing a robust and transparent system for managing access control, particularly in the healthcare domain.

## Features

- **Decentralized Access Control**: Secure and transparent access control using blockchain.
- **Patient Data Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval of patient data.
- **Doctor Access Management**: Manage which doctors have access to specific patient records.
- **Integration with Firebase**: Leverages Firebase for additional data storage and management.
    ```

## Usage

1. Register as a patient or doctor.
2. Patients can grant or revoke access to their data for specific doctors.
3. Doctors can view patient data if access is granted.

## Future Improvements

- **Reverse Mapping for Access Control**: Implement a reverse mapping mechanism to store which patients a doctor has access to. This will be achieved by storing the list of patients in Firebase documents associated with each doctor.
